TO USE:
First include jQuery:
<script type='text/javascript' src='<path_to_js>/jquery-1.4.2.min.js'></script>

Second, include the doubleRainbow plugin:
<script type='text/javascript' src='<path_to_js>/doubleRainbow.jQuery.js'></script>

Third, copy the file "rainbow.gif" from the images folder to your images folder. If you put it somewhere else be sure to update the path to the file in the "doubleRainbow.jQuery.js" script.

Fourth, in the <head> of your html include the js from the example below.

Finally, based on the selector below, add the rel="rainbow" attribute to any images you want to have the double rainbow.

EXAMPLE:
<script type='text/javascript'>
	$(function() {
		$(window).load( function() {
			$('img[rel="rainbow"]').doubleRainbow();
		});
	});
</script>
